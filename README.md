## üìù About Me

‚ú® I‚Äôm currently an undergraduate **Informatics engineering** student at **Universitas Binaniaga Indonesia**, learning the art of making computers do my bidding (except when they don‚Äôt).

üå± I‚Äôm currently diving deep into **web and mobile development**, still figuring out which is more frustrating: coding or choosing the perfect stack.
